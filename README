tmsdebug.py:
	This script runs a server to let you see how openlayers.html sends requests. Run it with IPython or it will finish immediately (or change the code).
	Server is at http://localhost:8080
	
openlayer.html:
	Sample openlayer page, needs to have the resolutions/extents/zooms modified later.
	This file. is safe to open locally, no need to get html from a webserver.
	Looks for images at http://localhost:8080/
